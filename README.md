# Spotimusic
## What is the project?
This is my original project for learning Python programming language and practice. The main goal of the project is making a music player app. The project started in August 2020.
### Projects current possibilites:
- Adding and playing songs
- Assigning them to a playlist
- Shuffle songs in active playlist
- Recommend songs from active playlist based on times listened to specific artist, genre or bpm (WIP)

### Planned features:
- [ ] Finish all the WIP (unfinished) features
- [ ] Make UI more user-frienly
- [ ] Add more song-playlist features
- [ ] Write my own music playback library

### Plans for repository:
- [x] Add gitignore file
- [ ] Add [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) support
- [ ] Gather user feedback to define features to add

## Project's future

### Updates
As I work on my project I'll post my progress in this github repository with features written down in this file. There **will** be other uploads, but I will only focus on updates, so that it's easier to define more stable and finished releases.

### Quantity, or quality?
I'm not trying to keep a regular shcedule to update the project, but I'll be productive, as much as I can. If I have a busy week, then there will be no progress at all. If I have free time, then I'll spend it on the project.
